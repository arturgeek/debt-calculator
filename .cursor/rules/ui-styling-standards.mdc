# UI and Styling Standards

## Component Library

- Import from `@/components/ui/` directory
- Follow shadcn/ui patterns and conventions

## Styling Approach
- Use Tailwind CSS for all styling
- Leverage the custom color scheme defined in [tailwind.config.ts](mdc:tailwind.config.ts)
- Use semantic color classes (primary, secondary, destructive, etc.)
- Apply responsive design with Tailwind breakpoints

## Layout Patterns
- Use Card components for content sections
- Implement proper spacing with Tailwind utilities
- Use Grid and Flexbox for responsive layouts
- Apply consistent padding and margins

## Form Components
- Use Input, Label, and Button components from shadcn/ui
- Implement proper form validation
- Use Tabs component for multi-step forms
- Apply consistent form spacing and layout

## Color Usage
- Primary colors for main actions and branding
- Secondary colors for supporting elements
- Destructive colors for errors and warnings
- Muted colors for disabled states
